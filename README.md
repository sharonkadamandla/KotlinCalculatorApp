# Kotlin Calculator App

## Overview

This is a simple calculator app built using Kotlin on Android Studio. The app performs basic arithmetic operations with the added feature of automatically copying results to the clipboard. It was an exciting way to explore Kotlin's capabilities as I transitioned from my prior experience in Java.

## Functionalities

## Technologies Used

Backend: Kotlin

Frontend: XML

Version Control: Git

## Learning Journey

Coming from a Java background, I was curious to explore Kotlin, which shares similarities but introduces modern features and concise syntax making it easy to read. Developing this app gave me hands-on experience with:

Building a user interface in XML.

Writing Kotlin code to handle user interactions.

Building and debugging using Android Studio and ChatGPT for understanding and resolving bugs efficiently.

## Future Improvements

Adding buttons for more complex calculations.

Enhancing the UI using React for a more modern and dynamic design.

Integrating a database to store calculation history and provide additional functionalities.

## Version Control

The project is managed using Git for version control, ensuring proper tracking of changes and facilitating collaboration in future iterations.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository: git clone < repository-url >

Open the project in Android Studio.

Run the app on an emulator or physical device.
